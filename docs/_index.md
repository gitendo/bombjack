to my personal Bomb Jack documentation project based on software disassembly, reverse engineering and other available sources.

You've probably [dissected Bomb Jack](https://floooh.github.io/2018/10/06/bombjack.html) along with Andre Weissflog. If not I really recommend reading it. Instead of emulating the game I've been digging into the software side to figure out inner workings and hidden secrets of this instant classic.  

My final goal is to provide working assembly source, ready for possible improvements. This is ongoing exploration project and might not be completed.
