[{"body":"\rto my personal Bomb Jack documentation project based on software disassembly, reverse engineering and other available sources.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve probably dissected Bomb Jack along with Andre Weissflog. If not I really recommend reading it. Instead of emulating the game I\u0026rsquo;ve been digging into the software side to figure out inner workings and hidden secrets of this instant classic.\nMy final goal is to provide working assembly source, ready for possible improvements. This is ongoing exploration project and might not be completed.\nCurrent progress:\ndisassembly (not public yet) reverse engineering (WIP) documentation (WIP) Explore\n","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/","section":"","title":"Welcome"},{"body":"The following table shows a short overview of Bomb Jack memory map as seen and used by Z80.\nAddress Size Type Access Description $0000 $1FFF ROM RO 09_j01b.bin $2000 $3FFF ROM RO 10_101b.bin $4000 $5FFF ROM RO 11_m01b.bin $6000 $7FFF ROM RO 12_n01b.bin $8000 $0FFF RAM RW general purpose RAM $9000 $03FF VRAM RW tile map $9400 $03FF VRAM RW tile attribute map $9820 $005F VRAM RW sprite / attribute map $9C00 $00FF CRAM WO palette data $9E00 - I/O WO background picture select $B000 - I/O RW joystick 1 and NMI mask $B001 - I/O RO joystick 2 $B002 - I/O RO coins and start button $B003 - I/O RW watchdog reset $B004 - I/O RW dip switch 1 and screen flip $B005 - I/O RO dip switch 2 $B006 - I/O RW sound latch $C000 $1FFF ROM RO 13.1r ","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/memory-map/","section":"","title":"Memory Map"},{"body":"Bomb Jack PCB has two dip switches to configure game settings. How the game accesses and makes use of them is explained right here.\nDS_1 $B004 (Read/Write)\nDS_1 value can be read from $B004. It\u0026rsquo;s being mirrored in RAM at $8013 and used accordingly. Factory DS_1 settings are: %11000000 which translates to demo sound on and upright mode.\nðŸ’¡ While $B004 seems like read only it actually is writable. Function at $4587 checks for two player game and when the mode is set to cocktail it writes 1 to flip the screen for player two and 0 back for player one.\nDemo sound\rOff %00000000 On %10000000 Mode\rCocktail %00000000 Upright %01000000 Lives\r3 %00000000 4 %00010000 5 %00100000 2 %00110000 Coin 2\r1 Coin - 1 Credit %00000000 2 Coins - 1 Credit %00000100 1 Coin - 2 Credits %00001000 1 Coin - 3 Credits %00001100 Coin 1\r1 Coin - 1 Credit %00000000 1 Coin - 2 Credits %00000001 1 Coin - 3 Credits %00000010 1 Coin - 6 Credits %00000011 DS_2 $B005 (Read Only)\nDS_2 value can be read from $B005. It\u0026rsquo;s being mirrored in RAM at $8014 and used accordingly. Factory defaults for DS_2 are: %01010000 which translates to high special coin ratio, hard difficulty and bird moving fast.\nðŸ’¡ On the contrary to DS_1 it is read only however it holds its own secret. According to manual, first three bits / switches are unused and should be turned off. But if you enable function at $5A07 by replacing $C9 (ret) with $F5 (push af) you\u0026rsquo;ll get access to unused \u0026ldquo;Extra lives\u0026rdquo; setting.\nSpecial coin appearance ratio\rHigh %00000000 Low %10000000 Enemy numbers and speed\rEasy %00100000 Medium %00000000 Hard %01000000 Hardest %01100000 Extra lives\rNone %00000000 100K Only %00000100 100K and 300K %00000110 50K Only %00000011 50K and 100K %00000101 50K, 100K and 300K %00000111 Every 100K %00000001 Every 30K %00000010 Bird speed\rSlow %00000000 Normal %00001000 Fast %00010000 Fastest %00011000 ","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/dip-switch/","section":"","title":"Dip Switch Settings"},{"body":"Here are external sources I\u0026rsquo;ve found useful and used in this project:\nBomb Jack at Strategy Wiki\nInstruction manual\nBomb Jack driver by Mirko Buffoni\n","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/sources/","section":"","title":"Sources"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/categories/","section":"categories","title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://gitendo.github.io/bombjack/tags/","section":"tags","title":"Tags"}]
